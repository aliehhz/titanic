Titanic Survival Prediction App

An interactive Streamlit web app that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics such as age, gender, class, and more.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, and deployment using Streamlit — making machine learning models easy to interact with and visualize.

🧠 Features

🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset

🧮 Trained a machine learning model for survival prediction

🎨 Built an interactive Streamlit interface for user input and prediction

📊 Visualized important features and model results

☁️ Prepared for deployment on Streamlit Cloud or similar platforms
